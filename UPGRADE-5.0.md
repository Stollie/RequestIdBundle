# Upgrade from 4.X to 5.X

Version 4 and 5 are again *functionally the same*, the only new things brought
to 5.X are support for Symfony ^6.0.

## Dropped Support for Symfony 5 < 5.4

Stick with v4 of this bundle should Symfony 5.{0-3} support be required.

5.4 is the only release of the 5.X series that is still supported.
